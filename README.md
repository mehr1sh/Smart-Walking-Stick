## **Project Overview**

The Smart Walking Stick leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to assist visually impaired users in navigating their environments safely and independently. By combining obstacle detection, location tracking, and voice feedback, the device aims to reduce accidents and provide peace of mind for both users and their families[1].

---

## **Features**

- **Obstacle Detection:** Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in the user’s path and provides real-time alerts via buzzer or vibration.
- **GPS Tracking:** Continuously tracks the user's location, enabling caregivers to monitor their whereabouts.
- **Emergency SOS:** Allows the user to send their location to a predefined contact in case of emergencies.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Lightweight, portable, and ergonomically designed for daily use[1].

---

## **Hardware Components**

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP8266/ESP32)
- Ultrasonic sensor(s) for obstacle detection
- GPS module for location tracking
- Buzzer and/or vibration motor for alerts
- Push button for SOS activation
- Power source (battery pack)
- GSM module for SMS-based SOS feature

---

## **Software and Technologies**

- Arduino IDE (or compatible microcontroller programming environment)
- Embedded C/C++ for microcontroller logic
- IoT communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, HTTP for cloud integration if applicable)
- GPS data parsing and processing

---

## **System Architecture**

1. **Sensing:** Ultrasonic sensors measure the distance to obstacles ahead.
2. **Processing:** The microcontroller processes sensor and GPS data, determines alerts, and manages user input.
3. **Alerting:** If an obstacle is detected within a critical range, the system triggers a buzzer or vibration motor.
4. **Location Tracking:** GPS module continuously updates the user’s location.
5. **Emergency Response:** On SOS button press, the system sends the user’s location to a caregiver via SMS or cloud service[1].

## **Installation & Setup**

1. **Hardware Assembly**
   - Connect ultrasonic sensors, GPS module, and the buzzer/vibration motor to the microcontroller as per the circuit diagram.
   - Secure components to the walking stick for stability and ease of use.

2. **Software Upload**
   - Install the Arduino IDE and required libraries (e.g., for GPS, ultrasonic sensor).
   - Clone or download the repository.
   - Open the main code file (e.g., `SmartWalkingStick.ino`).
   - Select the appropriate board and port.
   - Upload the code to the microcontroller.

3. **Power Up**
   - Connect a suitable battery pack to power the system.
